## Detailed analysis of the most interesting changes.

Create a independet deb packages. This features is very conveniently if you want to create server application.
For example i need to create simple server for my simple game. 
And my steps:
* build my application in the release mode.
* run cqtdeployer with deb option.

```
cqtdeployer -bin mySimpleServer deb -qmake ~/Qt/5.15.2/gcc_64/bin/qmake
```
Ð¬y SimpleServer depends only on qt, so it was enough for me to specify only the path to qmake for my application.

It is all!!!. And i get the workly deb package.

So lets see what contains the generated deb package.
